# MENACE_TicTacToe
This program what does is to test the concept of MENACE.
It's an implementation of the experiment "Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine"
MENACE was a mechanical computer made from 304 matchboxes designed and built by Artificial Intelligence pioneer Donald Michie in 1961, but I'm gonna use it as a basic learning
algorithm for a robot that plays tic tac toe.

In the main there's all the code that defines MENACE, and other functions for creating agents that do random moves, or the best possible move, so MENACE can be trained.
